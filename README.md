- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Confusion Matrix Visualization

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Naive Bayes





## 🧼 Preprocessing Steps
- Lowercasing
- Removing punctuation and stopwords
- Lemmatization
- Vectorization using TF-IDF
